# Selection Sort Info

**Selection Sort**: 
> Selection Sort is the improvement over Bubble Sort by making only one exchange for every pass thr' the list.
> It looks for the largest value in the list and places it at the last position as it makes a pass
> This method requires __(n-1)__ passes to sort __n__ items

### Example:
- (26 54 **93** 17 77 31 44 55 **20**) --> (26 54 **20** 17 77 31 44 55 **93**)
- (26 54 20 17 **77** 31 44 **55** 93) --> (26 54 20 17 **55** 31 44 **77** **93**)
- so on..
