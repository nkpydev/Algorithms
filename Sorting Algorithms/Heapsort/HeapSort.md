# Heap Sort

Before we dive into the basics of Heap Sort, we need to know 2 types of Data Structures:
-   Arrays
-   Trees

The numbers that we want to sort, are stored in Arrays.

Heapsort works by visualising the elements of array as a **complete binary tree**, which is known as **Heap**.


## Complete Binary Tree:

A full binary tree, which has below mentioned attributes:
-   Every level is completely filled.
-   All leaf elements lean towards left.
-   The last leaf element might not have a right sibling.
    - (i.e. complete binary tree doesnot have to be a full binary tree)

```
                    [1]

                [12]    [9]

            [5]     [6]

```
From this example you will see, that: 
- [x] Binary Tree
- [x] Full Tree
- [x] Complete Tree
